		This individualized research and study allowed me to gain familiarity with recognition as planning. <br>
		This study began from the grassroots, with an introduction to STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver) based planner, followed by an analysis of selected readings on plan recognition, to experimenting with Pyperplan source code, to finally reaching a point where I could start brainstorming my own ideas towards modifying plan recognition to incorporate multiple agents.

	<h3><a href="Notes.pdf">Notes Taken</a></h3>
	<p>Contains all the notes I have taken over the course of the semester. The notes with STRIPS, psuedo code for a recognition as planning implementation for Pyperplan that Rick helped me with, followed by Blocks World and Grid World problems I used to brainstorm different approaches to the multi agent problem. </p>

		The following readings were analysed in the order they are presented. This was my first time diving into analysing papers and thereby took a significant amount of time to understand scientific paper writing/reading.

		<p> After digging through the pyperplan source code, the example demonstration provided by Rick and a basic overview of the pseudocode, I was tasked towards writing the code for a recognition as planning (RAP) version of Pyperplan. This was the first time I was working with a Parser and therefore spent a great deal of time learning to utilize parts of the parser for my own puporses, as demonstrated with the code linked above. This allowed me to understand the implementation of what I had until then only learnt theoretically. Due to multiple bugs in the pyperplan parser itself, we decided to work on the RAP implementation this over the summer as it would have taken a significant amount of time to resolve it.</p>

	<p> Please note that being my first attempt to write a paper, it is far from ready. However, the paper consists of my overall research findings and idea that I hope to experiment with over the summer.</p>
