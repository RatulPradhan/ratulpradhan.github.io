**most functions and functionality were brainstormed together and implemented together where functionalities were spilt up into different functions, most generally seperated as a display form, helper, and SQL call function. For this reason, we delegated work for the functionality seperately. 
 **Alex worked on a majority of helper functions and independent function design while Ratul worked to integrate the different functions, piecing it together and worked on the design. 


*No incomplete functions exist.
